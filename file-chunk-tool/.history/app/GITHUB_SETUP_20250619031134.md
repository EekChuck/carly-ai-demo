# Adding This Project to Your GitHub Account

Follow these steps to add this project to your existing GitHub account (EekChuck).

## Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in to your EekChuck account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
3. Enter a repository name (e.g., "file-chunk-tool" or "whisper-chunker")
4. Add an optional description
5. Choose public or private visibility
6. Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license (since we already have these files locally)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Initialize Git in the Local Project

```bash
cd app
git init
```

## Step 3: Add Your Files to Git

```bash
git add .
```

## Step 4: Make the Initial Commit

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: File chunking service for Whisper transcription"
```

## Step 5: Connect to Your GitHub Repository

Replace `USERNAME` with your GitHub username (EekChuck) and `REPO_NAME` with the name you chose in Step 1:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/EekChuck/REPO_NAME.git
```

## Step 6: Push Your Code to GitHub

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

Note: If your default branch is named "master" instead of "main", use:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

## Step 7: Verify on GitHub

Go to `https://github.com/EekChuck/REPO_NAME` to verify that your code has been successfully pushed.
