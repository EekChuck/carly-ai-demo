# Resolving Git Push Rejection

You're encountering this error because the remote repository (`https://github.com/EekChuck/audio-chunker.git`) already contains commits that aren't in your local repository. Here are three ways to resolve this:

## Option 1: Pull First, Then Push (Recommended if you want to keep existing remote content)

This approach merges the remote content with your local changes:

```bash
# Pull the remote changes first
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

# Resolve any merge conflicts if they occur
# Then push your changes
git push origin main
```

The `--allow-unrelated-histories` flag is needed because the local and remote repositories have unrelated commit histories.

## Option 2: Force Push (Use with caution - overwrites remote content)

If you want to completely replace the remote repository content with your local content:

```bash
git push -f origin main
```

⚠️ **WARNING**: This will overwrite any existing content in the remote repository. Only use this if you're sure you want to discard all remote changes.

## Option 3: Create a New Branch

If you want to keep both versions separate:

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b file-chunker

# Push the new branch
git push origin file-chunker
```

This creates a new branch in the remote repository without affecting the main branch.

## Recommended Approach

Since you're adding a new project to an existing repository, I recommend Option 1 (pull first, then push) to preserve any existing content while adding your new files.

If the repository is empty or you want to completely replace its contents, you can use Option 2 (force push).
